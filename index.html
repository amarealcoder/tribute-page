          Lola Omolola (born August 1, 1976) is a Nigerian former journalist who
          founded the Female IN (FIN) group on Facebook. Lola is the first
          Nigerian woman who created a place where other women can share their
          untold stories regarding their sexual abuses, and other challenges
          they are facing. She was featured in the 2018 Facebook F8 Conference.

          immediate community.

        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
          Omolola completed her primary and secondary studies in Nigeria. After

        <h4>Career</h4>
        <p>
          Omolola is a former journalist, and she owned some TV shows in
          Nigeria. After earning her degree, she worked at the Community
          Counseling Centers of Chicago where she assisted people with mental
          health issues. Also, Omolola worked for "apartments.com" but decided
          to quit when she had children. As a result, she started her own
          website called "spicebaby.com" where she was providing recipes for
          Nigerian foods. Then she created FIN which is a Facebook private group
          page where women all over the world meet and share their stories
          without embarrassment. The group started as Female in Nigeria, but now
          changed to "Female IN" to accommodate its increasingly diverse
          membership. FIN has more than a million women who use this Facebook
          page. Omolola's goal is to help women who are struggling with life,
          but can not tell anyone about their issues because of tradition. In
          many countries like Nigeria, girls and women are voiceless. FIN has
          given a lot of women the platorm and courage to voice out their
          frustrations,disappointments, abuses, harrassments as wellas their
          happiness and breakthroughs in life without the fear of being judged.
          Thus, helping to end the culture of silence for women.

        <h4>Achievements</h4>
        <p>
          After she created FIN, Omolola met the Facebook founder Mark
          Zuckerberg. They discussed how women are getting support from FIN. In
          an interview with CNN, Mark Zuckerberg praised her for connecting
          voiceless women and building a safe community for them on Facebook.
          Lola is now planning to move forward with FIN by "providing centres
          where women can go to talk about their experiences in a safe space."
